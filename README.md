Analysis of the census data of New York City

For this project, my team and I analyzed the census data collected of New York City.
This dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/muonneutrino/new-york-city-census-data#nyc_census_tracts.csv)
contains data from the United States Census Bureau and revised by the 2015 American Community 
Survey 5-year Estimates. Each census tract block includes demographics and economic
characteristics of nearby NYC neighborhoods. We used Python and its many libraries to run
exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and data visualization to take raw statistical data
and convert them into useful information we can use to show certain trends.
