# NYC_CensusData
Analysis of the census data of New York City

For this project, my team and I analyzed the census data collected of New York City.
This dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/muonneutrino/new-york-city-census-data#nyc_census_tracts.csv)
contains data from the United States Census Bureau and revised by the 2015 American Community 
Survey 5-year Estimates. Each census tract block includes demographics and economic
characteristics of nearby NYC neighborhoods. 

We used Python and its many libraries (Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy) to run exploratory 
data analysis, data cleaning, and data visualization to take raw statistical data and convert
them into useful information we can use to show certain trends. At the end, we did some statistical 
hypothesis testing. 

These are the questions we asked and used data to answer:

--Population && Demographics--
1. How many people reside in each county?
2. Are there more males or females on average?
3. Which counties have the most and least number of blocks?
4. Which counties are most congested and which are the least congested? 
5. Is our Population normally distributed?

--Wealth and Ethnic Disparities--
6. What are the distribution of ethnicities per county?
7. What are the disparities in median household income and income per capita per county? 
8. What are the disparities of Poverty and ChildPoverty per county?
9. What are some, if any, correlations regarding income?

--Indicators of Wealth--
10. What are the mean and total values of job types worked for each county?
11. What are the mean and total values of "commuting means" taken for each county?
12. Is there any a correlation between Income and the "MeanCommute" time to work?

--Hypothesis Testing--
13. Do the proportions of work category also have a significant correlation with the county's social economic status? 
In other words, will these categories show more "private" employees in New York versus more "public" employees in the Bronx?
